It took a lot of time and effort to develop and maintain the application, and in order to compensate for this, I connected the monetization which absolutely should not disturb your stay on the Internet. All that she does is replace some links. No pop-ups, new tabs, etc. will not occur. But if it's critical for you, or you basically do not want to give me the opportunity to get a reward for my work, I'll understand this and again, I'll let you free this advertisement for free."
